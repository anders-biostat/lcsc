# How to get started with lcsc

As in the Guided Clustering Tutorial by Seurat, we will be using the PBMC dataset from 10X containing
2,700 single cells that were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500. The raw data are made availbe by 10X [here](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz).

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(Seurat)

# Load the PBMC dataset
pbmc.data <- Read10X(data.dir = "data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/")
# Initialize the Seurat object with the raw (non-normalized data).
pbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.data, project = "pbmc3k", min.cells = 3, min.features = 200)
pbmc
```
